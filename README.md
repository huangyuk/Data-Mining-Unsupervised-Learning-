# Data-Mining-Unsupervised-Learning

These are all the homeworks I completed in the 6 weeks unsupervised learning course. This course is the last part of the machine learning specialization offered by University of Washington on Coursera. I skip the supervised learning part because I first completed Stanford's machine learning emphasizing on supervised learning.
